<p>Using a dropper can be the easiest method for providing water to 
your Bearded Dragon. Of course, it might take a few tries to teach 
your Bearded Dragon. Although, it shouldnâ€™t be too hard. To use a 
dropper, simply drop some water on your Bearded Dragonâ€™s mouth and 
hopefully the reptile will begin to drink the water.</p>

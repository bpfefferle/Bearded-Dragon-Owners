        <h2>Housing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Custom-built enclosures are better than glass terrariums and should be 
                used if possible. The minimum size we suggest for a custom-built 
                enclosure is 48"W X 24"D x 24"H.</li>
                <li>Glass terrariums come in various sizes. We recommend using a 20 gallon 
                for one baby Bearded Dragon and a 40 gallon for one juvenile or adult Bearded Dragon. 
                For adults, anything bigger than a 40 gallon is better.</li>
                <li>In the wild, Bearded Dragons are territorial and live solitary lives. In captivity, Bearded 
                Dragons should not be housed together regardless of age or sex. In summary, housing Bearded 
                Dragons together is dangerous and detrimental to their mental health.</li>

    <!-- Lighting -->
    <div>
        <h2>Lighting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bearded Dragons require heat for their bodies to function properly, their 
                terrarium must have a cool side and a hot side. For the hot side, the temperature 
                should be around 100F. On the cool side, the temperature should be around 80F. To 
                achieve this temperature gradient, use an appropriate heat bulb.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Not only does a Bearded Dragon require heat, but they also require UVB to thrive. A 
                Bearded Dragon's enclosure should have a tube UVB bulb that spans two-thirds of the 
                enclosure's length. We suggest using the Reptisun 10.0 T5 HO, Reptisun 10.0 T8, or 
                the Arcadia 12%. In contrast, we do not recommend using small compact or coil UVB 
                bulbs as they do not provide the best UVB exposure.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>During the day, a Bearded Dragon's heat and UVB bulb should be on for 12-14 hours. After 
                12-14 hours, both the heat and UVB bulb should be off. At night, do not leave any lights on 
                as light at night can disturb their sleep. Although, if the temperature within the Bearded 
                Dragon's enclosure falls below 65F, then use a ceramic heat emitter bulb to provide heat 
                (do not use a colored bulb). In short, the nighttime temperature should be in the 70s.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Since Bearded Dragons require UVB to thrive, they will benefit from natural sunlight. 
                In other words, if you live in an area that has an outdoor temperature of at least 80F 
                (the closer to 95F the better), then taking your Bearded Dragon outside to soak up natural 
                UVB is a good idea. However, use caution and take preventative measures to avoid losing 
                your Bearded Dragon or allowing it to eat anything from outside. </li>

    <div>
        <h2>Substrate</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Loose substrate should not be used for a pet Bearded Dragon, loose substrate is 
                a substrate that contains many small moving parts such as wood chips, ground walnut 
                shells, sand, or dirt. Overall, loose substrate is dangerous if consumed. In addition, 
                these types of substrates tend to be unsanitary (think of a litter box).</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Instead of loose substrate, a solid substrate should be used. For example, non-adhesive 
                shelf liner, slate tile, reptile carpet, or even paper towels. In brief, solid substrates 
                are much safer and of course cleaner.</li>

        <h2>Tank Decor</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A Bearded Dragon's enclosure should have objects for climbing, basking, and 
                hiding. For example, a Bearded Dragon will enjoy a nice rock to bask on, a large 
                cave to hide in, and multiple sticks for climbing.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>A water dish is not necessary to include within a Bearded Dragon's enclosure 
                since Bearded Dragons rarely drink from still water and the water itself may 
                cause issues with humidity.</li>

    <div>
        <h2>Diet</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bearded Dragons are omnivores and require live food and vegetables in their diet.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Dubia roaches, silkworms, phoenix worms, and crickets are good choices for everyday feeders.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Turnip greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, and collard greens are good choices for everyday vegetables.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Mealworms, superworms, butterworms, waxworms, and hornworms should only be offered as treats.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Never offer food from outside to your pet Bearded Dragon, food from outside may be dangerous. For example, 
                outside food may have parasites or it may have come in contact with pesticides. In addition, some outside 
                foods could be toxic. In conclusion, it's not worth the risks.</li>

        <h2>Food Supplementation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In captivity, a Bearded Dragon may not receive important vitamins and minerals 
                that it requires to thrive. As a result, it is crucial to "dust" their live food 
                with calcium and multivitamin products.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Calcium will allow a Bearded Dragon to grow healthy bones. In order for a Bearded 
                Dragon to use calcium, proper UVB exposure must be provided so that a Bearded Dragon can 
                synthesize vitamin D3. Without vitamin D3, a Bearded Dragon cannot benefit from calcium. 
                In short, lack of UVB is equivalent to a Bearded Dragon not having vitamin D3 which results 
                in a Bearded Dragon not being able to use calcium. One way or another, a Bearded Dragon must 
                receive vitamin D3 in order to use calcium. If not, then health issues may 
                develop such as metabolic bone disease.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>A multivitamin will offer a variety of minerals and nutritional elements that Bearded 
                Dragons may lack in captivity. We recommend using a multivitamin product that contains 
                beta-carotene to reduce the threat of vitamin A toxicity.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>Bearded Dragons can overdose on vitamin D3 and calcium. For that reason, a well-balanced 
                dusting schedule should be provided along with proper lighting in general.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>For baby and juvenile Bearded Dragons, we suggest dusting with calcium daily, but only 
                once per day. In addition, we advise using multivitamins at least twice per week.</li>

        <h2>Cleaning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It is a good idea to make a habit of cleaning a Bearded Dragon's enclosure 
                on a daily basis. To clean a Bearded Dragon's enclosure, all poop should be 
                removed along with spoiled food (e.g. dead bugs, old veggies, etc). Also, the 
                enclosure should be disinfected with an appropriate disinfectant that will kill 
                bacteria. For obvious reasons, please let the reptile's enclosure dry out before 
                letting it go back inside of the enclosure if disinfectants were used.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>A Bearded Dragon should be offered a bath at least once per week to help keep 
                the reptile clean. When offering a bath to a Bearded Dragon, the water should be 
                kept warm at all times and the reptile should be able to comfortably stand.</li>
                <!--  -->
                <li>If a Bearded Dragon is forced to live in an unsanitary environment, then it 
                could develop health issues such as yellow fungus disease.</li>

<h2 id="1-use-a-dropper">#1. Use a Dropper</h2>

<p>Using a dropper can be the easiest method for providing water to 
your Bearded Dragon. Of course, it might take a few tries to teach 
your Bearded Dragon. Although, it shouldnâ€™t be too hard. To use a 
dropper, simply drop some water on your Bearded Dragonâ€™s mouth and 
hopefully the reptile will begin to drink the water.</p>

<h2 id="2-mist-greens">#2. Mist Greens</h2>

<p>Misting greens (or simply getting greens wet) before allowing your Bearded Dragon 
to eat them is also another good method for hydrating your Bearded Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="3-offer-a-hornworm">#3. Offer a Hornworm</h2>

<p>Hornworms are tasty treats for Bearded Dragons, these treats have a lot of moisture and are 
great for hydrating your Bearded Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="4-offer-a-water-dish">#4. Offer a Water Dish</h2>

<p>Bearded Dragons rarely drink from still water. However, it is still possible to train a 
Bearded Dragon to recognize that water dishes are good. For example, you can fill a dish 
with water and use your finger to make the water move. As a result, the reptile may become 
interested in the splashing water and may attempt to drink from it. Again, this may be 
the hardest method for providing water to a Bearded Dragon. Although, it is worth a try 
if you have the patience.</p>

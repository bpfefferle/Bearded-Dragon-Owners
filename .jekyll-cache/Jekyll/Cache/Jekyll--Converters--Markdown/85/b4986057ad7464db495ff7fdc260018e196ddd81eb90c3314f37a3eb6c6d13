<h2 id="1-use-a-dropper">#1. Use a Dropper</h2>

<p>Using a dropper can be the easiest method for providing water to 
your Bearded Dragon. Of course, it might take a few tries to teach 
your Bearded Dragon. Although, it shouldnâ€™t be too hard. To use a 
dropper, simply drop some water on your Bearded Dragonâ€™s mouth and 
hopefully the reptile will begin to drink the water.</p>

<h2 id="2-theyre-diurnal">#2. Theyâ€™re Diurnal</h2>

<p>Bearded Dragons are diurnal, this means that they are active 
during the day and sleep during the night. For obvious reasons, 
having a pet available to interact with during the day is ideal 
since humans are also diurnal (well, at least most of us are). In 
short, if youâ€™re looking for a daytime reptile, then look no further!</p>

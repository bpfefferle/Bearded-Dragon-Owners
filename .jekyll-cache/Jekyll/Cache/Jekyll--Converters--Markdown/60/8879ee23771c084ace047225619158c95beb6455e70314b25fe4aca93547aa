<h2 id="1-improper-lighting">#1. Improper Lighting</h2>

<p>It is crucial that a Bearded Dragonâ€™s enclosure has a correct temperature 
gradient along with proper UVB exposure. To clarify, the hot side of the 
enclosure should be around 100F while the cool side of the enclosure should 
be around 80F. Furthermore, a Bearded Dragonâ€™s enclosure should have a 
tube UVB bulb (such as the reptisun 10.0 T5 HO bulb) that spans 2/3 of the 
enclosureâ€™s length. Overall, if a Bearded Dragon does not have the correct 
heat temperature or vitamin D3 (obtained from UVB), then its body will not 
function properly which could lead to an unhappy reptile.</p>

<h2 id="2-stress">#2. Stress</h2>

<p>If a Bearded Dragon is stressed, then it may not eat. Unfortunately, Bearded 
Dragons can stress easily for various reasons. For example, a Bearded Dragon 
can get stressed out if it sees another Bearded Dragon (even if its his or 
her own reflection in the glass). Also, a Bearded Dragon may get stressed 
out from shedding or being mishandled. Ultimately, if you suspect that 
your Bearded Dragon is stressed out, then youâ€™ll have to identify what 
may be causing stress and eliminate it from the equation.</p>

<h2 id="3-an-illness">#3. An Illness</h2>

<p>For obvious reasons, if a Bearded Dragon is sick or becoming severely 
ill, then it may not be interested in eating or it may be uncapable 
of eating on its own. For instance, if a Bearded Dragon is severely 
impacted, then it may stop eating. Of course, if you suspect that 
your Bearded Dragon is ill, then it is best to rush to a herp vet 
as soon as possible. Visit our <a href="/bearded-dragon-health.html" target="_blank">health page</a> 
for more information regarding health.</p>

<h2 id="4-brumation">#4. Brumation</h2>

<p>In the wild, a Bearded Dragon will brumate during winter when temperatures 
are low and food is scarce. Brumation is a Bearded Dragonâ€™s version of 
hibernation. In captivity, most Bearded Dragons will not brumate since we 
control their temperatures and access to food all year round. However, it 
is still possible for a Bearded Dragon to brumate based off of pure instincts. 
If this is the case, then a Bearded Dragon will stop eating in general as 
it goes through its brumation period (sleep and less activity).</p>

<h2 id="5-picky-eaters">#5. Picky Eaters</h2>

<p>Bearded Dragons can be picky eaters. One week, a Bearded Dragon might love 
to eat crickets, but then have no interest in them the next week. In this 
scenario, it is suggested to offer variety in a Bearded Dragonâ€™s diet and 
mix things up. If the crickets arenâ€™t working, then try dubia roaches and 
so on. If a Bearded Dragon continues to show no interest, then consider 
if the Bearded Dragon is mentally and physically healthy and has the 
correct enclosure setup. Again, a Bearded Dragon may not eat if it is 
not mentally or physically healthy and has an improper enclosure setup.</p>

<h2 id="species">Species</h2>

<p>In the wild, there are several different types of Bearded Dragon 
species. All Bearded Dragons originate from Australia and 
may be found in various regions of the continent. For instance, 
a Pogona vitticeps (the Bearded Dragon species that is often 
found available for sale in the pet industry) can be found in 
Central Australia, hence the reason it is known as a Central (or Inland) 
Bearded Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="morphs">Morphs</h2>

<p>In captivity, Bearded Dragons have been bred to feature various 
patterns, colors, and other types of traits. In brief, these 
unique Bearded Dragons are known as Bearded Dragon morphs. In 
other words, these reptiles are variant forms of a standard 
Bearded Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="scale-type">Scale Type</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Normal.</li>
    <li>Leatherback.</li>
    <li>Dunner.</li>
    <li>Silkback.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scale type refers to the actual scales of the reptile. For example, a Bearded Dragon 
with normal scales will have rigid scales all over its body. In contrast, a leatherback 
Bearded Dragon will have a very smooth back (lacking rigid scales). Furthermore, a dunner 
Bearded Dragon will have scales that point in different directions (lacking symmetry) while 
a silkback Bearded Dragon will lack scales completely (extremely soft skin).</p>

<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Yellow.</li>
    <li>Red.</li>
    <li>Orange.</li>
    <li>White.</li>
    <li>Silver.</li>
    <li>Gray.</li>
    <li>Mixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>A wild Bearded Dragon may have basic colors such as tan, yellow, or shades of green. Although, 
Bearded Dragons in the pet industry have been bred to feature ‚Äúeye-catching‚Äù colors that really 
standout. For example, some Bearded Dragon morphs may be completely red, yellow, 
or even white. In addition, some Bearded Dragons may have a variety of colors on their body such 
as orange and red together. Overall, there‚Äôs a lot of options as far as color goes when it comes 
to captive Bearded Dragons.</p>

<h2 id="other-traits">Other Traits</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Hypomelanistic.</li>
    <li>Translucent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some Bearded Dragon morphs may have specific traits. For instance, a hypomelanistic Bearded 
Dragon (or hypo for short) is a Bearded Dragon with clear white nails rather than black nails. Also, 
a hypo Bearded Dragon will often be lighter in color rather than darker. Moving on, a translucent 
Bearded Dragon will have solid black eyes and transparent/translucent skin.</p>

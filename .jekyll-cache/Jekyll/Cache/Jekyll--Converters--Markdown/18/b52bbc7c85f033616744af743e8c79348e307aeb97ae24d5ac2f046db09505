<p>Hello, my name is Brent! There are two things to know about me 
that would help explain how my community came into existence. 
That is, I love computers and I'm a Bearded Dragon owner. Allow me 
to elaborate, I created the Bearded Dragon Owners Facebook page 
back in 2015. At the same time, I was majoring in computer science. 
As the years went on, I combined my knowledge of computers along 
with my interest in Bearded Dragons. In other words, I grew a community 
through social media management, image and video editing, and web development.</p>

<h2>Meet My Bearded Dragons</h2>

<p>Over the past decade, I have had five Bearded Dragons as pets. Although, I've 
also bred and sold Bearded Dragons before. Long story short, I have spent a lot 
of time with Bearded throughout the years. Overall, I think 
Bearded Dragons are awesome!</p>

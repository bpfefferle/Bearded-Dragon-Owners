<p>Bearded Dragons are considered to be friendly reptiles, a Bearded 
Dragon will only bite if it feels threatened. If you properly 
handle a Bearded Dragon and treat it nicely, then the reptile 
will most likely never act aggresive towards you. In other words, 
the reptile will have no issue with being handled. Overall, since 
Bearded Dragons are friendly, they can be good pets for kids, 
teenagers, or adults.</p>

<h2 id="2-theyre-diurnal">#2. Theyâ€™re Diurnal</h2>

<p>Bearded Dragons are diurnal, this means that they are active 
during the day and sleep during the night. For obvious reasons, 
having a pet available to interact with during the day is ideal 
since humans are also diurnal (well, at least most of us are). In 
short, if youâ€™re looking for a daytime reptile, then look no further!</p>

# {{ page.title }}

It may not always be easy to tell if your Bearded 
Dragon is sick. On this page, we hope to help you 
understand some of the more common illnesses out 
there for Bearded Dragons. However, if you suspect 
that your Bearded Dragon is ill, then you should 
always make it your priority to seek out a qualified 
herp vet and follow his or her advice rather than the 
advice found on this page. Thank you for understanding.

## Healthy Signs

There are a few things to look for in a healthy Bearded Dragon. 
First, a healthy Bearded Dragon should be active and alert. 
In other words, a Bearded Dragon should be basking throughout 
the day and eating food when offered. Second, a Bearded Dragon 
should not have any physical injuries or infections. For example, 
a Bearded Dragon should not have any unhealed tail nips nor should 
it have an eye infection. Third, a healthy Bearded Dragon should 
be growing (shedding) and gaining weight as it gets older. Overall, 
these are the basic signs of a healthy Bearded Dragon.

## Unhealthy Signs

An unhealthy Bearded Dragon is (for obvious reasons) the opposite 
of a healthy Bearded Dragon. To clarify, if a Bearded Dragon is 
acting lethargic (not eating or basking), is losing weight, or not 
growing, then the Bearded Dragon may be ill. Of course, physical 
injuries or infections would not be good either. In summary, these 
are the basic signs of an unhealthy Bearded Dragon.

## Metabolic Bone Disease

Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is one of the more common illnesses 
that pet Bearded Dragons get. In general, this disease is often 
caused by poor husbandry. More specifically, metabolic bone 
disease is often the result of calcium and vitamin D3 deficiency 
(or an improper balance of the two). In short, metabolic bone 
disease will cause a Bearded Dragon to have weak bones which will 
lead to many health issues overall.

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Bowed legs.</li>
    <li>Bumps in the legs or spine.</li>
    <li>Deformed appearance.</li>
    <li>Jerky movements.</li>
    <li>Lack of appetite.</li>
    <li>Lethargic behavior.</li>
    <li>Paralysis of the legs.</li>
    <li>Swollen limbs or jaw.</li>
    <li>Twitching in the legs or toes.</li>
</ul>

If you suspect that your Bearded Dragon has metabolic bone disease, 
then there are two things that you should do. First, seek out a 
qualified herp vet to determine the severity of the illness. Second, 
make sure that you are providing proper care for your Bearded 
Dragon. Unfortunately, there is no cure for this disease. However, 
you can prevent it from getting worse by providing proper care.

## Yellow Fungus Disease

Yellow fungus disease (CANV) is a fungal infection. A Bearded Dragon can 
get yellow fungus from unsanitary living conditions. In addition, 
it can get yellow fungus from any other reptile or item that is 
infected by it. For that reason, any reptile with yellow fungus 
should be quarantined and items should not be shared. In brief, 
yellow fungus is a very contagious, painful, and often fatal 
fungal infection for reptiles in general.

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Lack of appetite</li>
    <li>Lethargic behavior</li>
    <li>Patches of yellow or brown on scales</li>
    <li>The patches are spreading</li>
</ul>

Sadly, there are mixed reports whether or not there is a cure 
for yellow fungus disease. Regardless, if your Bearded Dragon has 
yellow fungus, then it would be best to visit a qualified herp vet 
and hope for the best.

## Atadenovirus

Atadenovirus (ADV) is a contagious disease commonly seen in 
Bearded Dragons, this disease may also be known as "star-gazing" 
or "wasting disease". A Bearded Dragon can get this disease if it 
is exposed to other Bearded Dragons that carry it. If contracted, 
the virus will remain with the Bearded Dragon for life and it 
will cause many problems such as a weak immune system or damage 
to the nervous system. Overall, atadenovirus is a very unfortunate 
disease to contract.

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Constantly looking upward (stargazing)</li>
    <li>Difficulty walking</li>
    <li>Lack of appetite</li>
    <li>Lethargic behavior</li>
    <li>Seizures</li>
    <li>Twitching</li>
</ul>

Sad to say, but there is no cure for atadenovirus. Although, if you 
suspect that your Bearded Dragon has it, then be sure to quarantine 
the reptile and visit a qualified herp vet as soon as possible for 
professional advice and treatment.

## Respiratory Infection

A respiratory infection (RI) is a bacterial infection located in the 
lungs of a Bearded Dragon. A Bearded Dragon may get a respiratory 
infection from bad husbandry, such as low temperatures and high 
humidity. 

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Lack of appetite</li>
    <li>Lethargic behavior</li>
    <li>Breathing difficulties</li>
    <li>Making noise while breathing</li>
    <li>Mucus near mouth and nostrils</li>
</ul>

If you suspect that your Bearded Dragon has a respiratory infection, 
then go to a herp vet for professional advice and treatment. In 
the meantime, make sure your Bearded Dragon's husbandry is correct.

## Dehydration

Dehydration occurs when a Bearded Dragon does not consume enough water. Fortunately, a Bearded 
Dragon will get most of their hydration needs met from the food it eats. However, it is still 
possible for a Bearded Dragon to dehydrate. Thus, it is a good idea to make sure 
that your Bearded Dragon receives opportunities to consume water.

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Drinks a lot when offered water</li>
    <li>Lack of appetite</li>
    <li>Lethargic behavior</li>
    <li>Sunken eyes</li>
    <li>Wrinkled skin</li>
</ul>

If your Bearded Dragon is dehydrated, then please watch <a href="https://youtu.be/TWFkxuUqKks" target="_blank">this video</a> for a visual guide on how to provide water. 

## Impaction

If a Bearded Dragon has a blockage within its digestive system (such as a foreign object that was consumed), 
then the reptile may not be able to poop. This inability to poop is often known as impaction. In short, 
impaction is often caused by the reptile consuming a foreign object such as its substrate or something 
that it found and tried to eat while exploring the house.

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Unable to poop.</li>
    <li>Foreign objects in poop, such as sand.</li>
    <li>Lack of appetite.</li>
    <li>Lethargic behavior.</li>
    <li>Not pooping for multiple days.</li>
    <li>Poorly digested stool.</li>
    <li>Paralysis of back legs.</li>
</ul>

In the event that a Bearded Dragon consumed a foriegn object, then it is best to 
rush to a qualified herp vet as soon as possible. If the foreign object cannot 
pass through its digestive system, then time is of the essence. 

In the scenario that the Bearded Dragon is just constipated (maybe from hard 
to digest foods like mealworms), then you may be able to help the reptile 
poop in one of two ways. First, increase the basking temperature to around 
100F. In general, heat will help a Bearded Dragon digest food and heat is 
important for their bodies to function properly. Second, offer the Bearded 
Dragon a warm bath with gentle belly rubs. If lucky, the Bearded Dragon will 
poop. At the end of the day, if the reptile does not poop for more than 
several days and starts to act lethargic, then rush to a qualified herp vet.

## Internal Parasites

A Bearded Dragon can get parasites if it eats something that had parasites, 
at least this is often how they get parasites.

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Discolored stool.</li>
    <li>Extremely foul stool (more foul than usual).</li>
    <li>Lack of appetite.</li>
    <li>Poorly digested stool.</li>
    <li>Weight loss.</li>
</ul>

If you suspect that your Bearded Dragon has internal parasites, then 
it is best to visit a qualified herp vet to confirm if this is the case 
and then proceed with treatment based off of the vet's advice. Unfortunately, 
there is not much you can do here on your own besides seek professional advice 
and treatment.

## Mouth Rot

Mouth rot (infectious stomatitis) is a bacterial infection within the mouth of 
a Bearded Dragon that can occur from bad husbandry. 

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>Black or loose teeth.</li>
    <li>Discolored mouth (white, ylelow, or grey).</li>
    <li>BLack of appetite.</li>
    <li>Lethargic behavior.</li>
</ul>

If you suspect that your Bearded Dragon has mouth rot, then we suggest 
seeking out a qaulified herp vet for professional advice and treatment.

## Tail Rot

Tail rot is a condition in which the Bearded Dragon's tail begins to 
rot, due to an internal infection. Tail rot often occurs from retained 
shed (cutting off blood circulation) or from physical trauma to the tail. 

Symptoms:

<ul>
    <li>A black tail.</li>
    <li>Black part of the tail feels hard.</li>
    <li>Black part of the tail looks shriveled.</li>
    <li>Black part of the tail is progressing towards the body.</li>
</ul>

If a Bearded Dragon has tail rot, then it is recommended to seek out a 
qaulified herp vet so that the infected part of the tail can be amputated. We 
do not advise waiting for the tail to fall off on its own (which is possible). 
If the infection reaches the reptile's internal organs, then this could be fatal. 
Therefore, it is best to have a qualified herp vet amputate the infected part of 
the tail.

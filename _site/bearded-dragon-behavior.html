    <h1>Common Bearded Dragon Behaviors</h1>

<p>Bearded Dragons exhibit several types of behaviors 
through body language. As a Bearded Dragon owner, 
it is important to understand all the different 
behaviors that a Bearded Dragon may display.</p>

<h2 id="defense">Defense</h2>

<p>There are a few things that a Bearded Dragon might 
do if it feels the need to defend itself. First, it 
will make itself appear larger by flattening its 
stomach and puffing out its beard. Second, it will 
open its mouth and it may even make a hissing noise. 
Third, it may decide to bite. Last but not least, the 
Bearded Dragon may flee as a last resort.</p>

<h2 id="head-bobbing">Head Bobbing</h2>

<p>Head bobbing is considered a dominant behavior for 
Bearded Dragons. A Bearded Dragon will bob its head 
up and down to display dominance over another Bearded 
Dragon. For example, if a male sees another male, 
then a territorial dispute may occur which will 
involve head bobbing and fighting. The faster the 
head bobbing, the more threatening the Bearded Dragon 
may appear. As another example, if a male sees a female 
Bearded Dragon, then head bobbing may be used to display 
dominance along with a desire to mate. Overall, head 
bobbing is commonly seen in males, but female Bearded 
Dragons are also capable of head bobbing for similiar 
reasons (dominance).</p>

<h2 id="arm-waving">Arm Waving</h2>

<p>Arm waving is considered a submissive behavior for 
Bearded Dragons. Often, arm waving is a response to 
head bobbing (or simply seeing another Bearded Dragon). 
For example, if one Bearded Dragon is head bobbing, then 
the other Bearded Dragon may submit by arm waving. In short, 
when a Bearded Dragon waves one of its arms in a circular motion, 
the reptile is saying, “I am aware of your presence and I am not 
a threat to you.”</p>

<h2 id="glass-surfing">Glass Surfing</h2>

<p>Glass surfing is a term used to describe what a Bearded Dragon does 
when it wants out of its enclosure. To clarify, if a Bearded Dragon 
is constantly pacing back and forth while scratching (or jumping) at 
the walls of its enclosure, then this is known as glass surfing. Usually, 
glass surfing means that your Bearded Dragon is stressed out and something 
is bothering it (such as seeing another Bearded Dragon). However, glass 
surfing does not always mean stress. Instead, it could simply mean that a 
Bearded Dragon wants to come out to explore. In conclusion, if your Bearded 
Dragon is glass surfing, then make sure nothing is causing it to be stressed 
out.</p>

<h2 id="brumation">Brumation</h2>

<p>Brumation is a Bearded Dragon’s version of hibernation. In the wild, an adult 
Bearded Dragon will brumate during winter to survive colder temperatures and 
lack of food. In captivity, Bearded Dragons do not have much of a reason to 
brumate. However, it is still possible. When a Bearded Dragon decides to 
brumate, it may sleep for weeks or even months. Ultimately, brumation is 
a normal and instinctive behavior for a Bearded Dragon but you should always 
make sure that your Bearded Dragon is not sick before assuming that it is 
brumating.</p>

<h2 id="shedding">Shedding</h2>

<p>As a Bearded Dragons gets older, it will shed its skin. At a young age, Bearded 
Dragons shed often and they slow down on shedding when they get older. When a 
Bearded Dragon is ready to shed, its skin (scales) may appear dull in color or 
white and grey. In summary, shedding is a normal process but it could be a 
stressful time for a Bearded Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="licking">Licking</h2>

<p>Bearded Dragons lick their surroundings often, they lick things around 
them to get a better idea of what that thing may be. In a way, you can 
think about it as if a human picked up an oject to get a better look 
at it.</p>

<h2 id="gaping">Gaping</h2>

<p>While basking, a Bearded Dragon may open its mouth. An open mouth 
while basking is known as gaping. In brief, this is how a Bearded 
Dragon regulates its body temperature.</p>

<h2 id="stacking">Stacking</h2>

<p>When a Bearded Dragon lays on top of another, this is known as 
stacking. You’ll often see this when multiple Bearded Dragons 
are housed in a single enclosure (which we do not recommend). New 
owners assume Bearded Dragons are friendly with each other, but 
they are not. Instead, Bearded Dragons are very territorial and 
stacking is considered a dominant behavior. In conclusion, the 
Bearded Dragon on top is the dominant Bearded Dragon and is 
taking up the best basking spot.</p>

<h2 id="digging">Digging</h2>

<p>Bearded Dragons enjoy digging since they are burrowers. If a 
Bearded Dragon is digging non-stop, then it may be trying to 
dig a hole in attempt to hide or sleep somewhere. In addition, 
if a female Bearded Dragon is digging endlessly, then she may 
have eggs to lay. Overall, digging is a natural behavior.</p>

<h2 id="tail-twitching">Tail Twitching</h2>

<p>A Bearded Dragon may twitch its tail (like a cat) while preparing 
for a fight with another Bearded Dragon. It is unclear what does 
tail twitching mean exactly, although if a Bearded Dragon often 
shows this type of behavior before a territorial dispute, then 
it must be communicating something bad.</p>

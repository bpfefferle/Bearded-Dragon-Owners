## Omnivores

Bearded Dragons are omnivores, they eat food of both plant 
and animal origin. In summary, it is important that a 
Bearded Dragon's diet has variety and is not restricted to 
any one type of food. This post is a basic introduction to what 
Bearded Dragons eat. For more information on food supplementation, 
gut-loading, or food scheduling, read our care guide <a href="https://beardeddragonowners.com/bearded-dragon-care-guide.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## 1) Live Food

At a young age, Bearded Dragons will rely more on live 
food to thrive. Dubia roaches would be a great choice 
as an everyday staple feeder for your reptile. Though, 
other options exist as well as seen below.

**Daily Choices:**
- Dubia roaches (Dusting recommended).
- Crickets (Dusting recommended).
- Phoenix worms.
- Silkworms.

**Treats Only:**
- Butterworms (Fattening).
- Waxworms (Fattening).
- Superworms (Fattening).
- Mealworms (Digestion risk).
- Hornworms (Mostly moisture).

## 2) Vegetables & Fruits

As Bearded Dragons get older, they may show more 
interest in vegetables. However, it's advised to 
make a habit of offering both live food and vegetables 
at a young age. Again, a diet full of variety is key.

**Suggested Veggies & Fruit:**

- Mustard greens.
- Dandelion greens.
- Turnip greens.
- Collard greens.
- Endive.
- Escarole.
- Butternut Squash.
- Acorn Squash.

**Veggies & Fruits to Avoid:**

Not all vegetables are safe or nutritional for Bearded Dragons. If 
you are ever unsure if a Bearded Dragon can eat something, then 
please do research first or simply do not attempt it. In the meantime, 
here is a brief list of vegetables and fruits to avoid.

- Lettuce (No nutritional value).
- Spinach (Calcium binding).
- Beet Tops (Calcium binding).
- Rhubarb (Toxic).
- Avocado (Toxic).
- Citrus fruits (Calcium binding).

**Fruits as Treats:**

There is not much to say about most fruits, besides the fact 
that they should be offered as treats only. Below, is a 
small list of fruits to try. Again, as treats only. For other 
fruits not listed here, additional research is recommended.

- Apples.
- Bananas.
- Blueberries.
- Blackberries.
- Cantaloupe.
- Strawberries.


## 3) Food From Outside (Dangerous)

A pet Bearded Dragon should never be offered 
food from outside. In other words, never offer 
a Bearded Dragon a wild insect, a small rodent, or 
any vegetation from outside. In brief, doing so 
could be risky for various reasons. For example, a wild bug 
could have parasites, an illness, or an infection. Moreso, some 
bugs (fireflies) are toxic to Bearded Dragons. Thus, it is better 
to be safe than sorry. With that said, you could always grow your 
own vegetables for your Bearded Dragon to eat, just be sure that 
your crop is free from any presticides.

## Omnivores

Bearded Dragons are omnivores, they eat food of both plant 
and animal origin. In summary, it is important that a 
Bearded Dragon's diet has variety and is not restricted to 
any one type of food. This post is a basic introduction to what 
Bearded Dragons eat. For more information on food supplementation, 
gut-loading, or food scheduling, read our care guide <a href="https://beardeddragonowners.com/bearded-dragon-care-guide.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## 1) Live Food

At a young age, Bearded Dragons will rely more on live 
food to thrive. Dubia roaches would be a great choice 
as an everyday staple feeder for your reptile. Though, 
other options exist as well as seen below.

**Daily Choices:**
- Dubia roaches (Dusting recommended).
- Crickets (Dusting recommended).
- Phoenix worms.
- Silkworms.

**Treats Only:**
- Butterworms (Fattening).
- Waxworms (Fattening).
- Superworms (Fattening).
- Mealworms (Digestion risk).
- Hornworms (Mostly moisture).

## 2) Vegetables & Fruits

As Bearded Dragons get older, they may show more 
interest in vegetables. However, it's advised to 
make a habit of offering both live food and vegetables 
at a young age. Again, a diet full of variety is key.

**Daily Choices:**

- Mustard greens.
- Dandelion greens.
- Turnip greens.
- Collard greens.
- Endive.
- Escarole.
- Butternut Squash.
- Acorn Squash.

**Treats Only:**

There is not much to say about most fruits, besides the fact 
that they should be offered as treats only. Below, is a 
small list of fruits to try. Again, as treats only. For other 
fruits not listed here, additional research is recommended.

- Apples.
- Bananas.
- Blueberries.
- Blackberries.
- Cantaloupe.
- Strawberries.

## 3) List of Dangerous Foods

Certain foods should never be offered to a 
Bearded Dragon. If you are ever unsure if 
your reptile can eat something, then simply 
do not attempt it until further research 
is done. Overall, some foods may have no 
nutritional value or could be toxic for 
a Bearded Dragon. Below, are examples 
of unsafe foods (or foods to avoid). 
Though, there could be more not included here.

**Never Offer:**

- Lettuce (No nutritional value).
- Spinach (Calcium binding).
- Beet Tops (Calcium binding).
- Rhubarb (Toxic).
- Avocado (Toxic).
- Citrus fruits (Calcium binding).
- Food from outside (Parasites, pesticides, or toxic).

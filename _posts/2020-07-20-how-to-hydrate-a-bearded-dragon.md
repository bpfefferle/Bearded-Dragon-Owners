## #1. Use a Dropper

Using a dropper can be the easiest method for providing water to 
your Bearded Dragon. Of course, it might take a few tries to teach 
your Bearded Dragon. Although, it shouldn't be too hard. To use a 
dropper, simply drop some water on your Bearded Dragon's mouth and 
hopefully the reptile will begin to drink the water.

## #2. Mist Greens

Misting greens (or simply getting greens wet) before allowing your Bearded Dragon 
to eat them is also another good method for hydrating your Bearded Dragon.

## #3. Offer a Hornworm

Hornworms are tasty treats for Bearded Dragons, these treats have a lot of moisture and are 
great for hydrating your Bearded Dragon.

## #4. Offer a Water Dish

Bearded Dragons rarely drink from still water. However, it is still possible to train a 
Bearded Dragon to recognize that water dishes are good. For example, you can fill a dish 
with water and use your finger to make the water move. As a result, the reptile may become 
interested in the splashing water and may attempt to drink from it. Again, this may be 
the hardest method for providing water to a Bearded Dragon. Although, it is worth a try 
if you have the patience.

## Why Dubia Roaches

Simply put, Bearded Dragons love Dubia roaches! I wouldn't know personally, but 
my Bearded Dragons tell me that they taste delicious! Most importantly, these feeder 
insects offer a lot of nutritional value for your Bearded Dragon. Besides that, 
Dubia roaches are much more convenient for reptile owners in terms 
of keeping compared to feeder insects like crickets. For example, Dubia roaches 
do not jump, climb, or fly. However, they can glide if they fall off of a high 
object. Regardless, these creatures are not great escape artists making them easy 
to keep. Even better, Dubia roaches are easy to breed and they have a long 
lifespan which can save reptile owners a lot of money. To get started with 
your own Dubia roach colony, here are a few things that you'll need to do.

## 1) Provide Space

To begin, you'll need a large sterilite tub (with a lid) to house the Dubia roaches, 
preferably a dark tub to satisfy their need for darkness. You should also include 
egg crates so that the Dubia roaches are not forced to climb all over each other 
on the ground. Proper ventilation is also important, you can make small ventilation holes 
in the lid of the tub using a hot soldering iron or simply cut out the holes 
yourself. If you cut out a large hole, then it would be best to include a screen cover. 
Not only will proper ventilation keep the housing environment dry, but the lid itself 
will also protect the colony from any unwanted visitors. Moving on, it is not 
recommended to provide any substrate.

## 2) Provide Heat

Dubia roaches will require a temperature up to 90F to truly thrive, there are 
a few ways to achieve the proper temperature in their habitat. For example, an 
adhesive under tank heater (ZooMed UTH) could be used on the outside of the tub 
or a ceramic heat emitter (CHE) could be used to provide heat from above. Of course, 
there are other options as well, such as using a thermostat or lamp dimmer. Regardless of 
what option you choose, it is important to be safe and avoid potential fire hazards. 
Basically, be certain to fully understand your heat setup and experiment with it until 
you're certain it is safe and will provide the correct temperature. Also, be sure to provide external heat for the colony, not heat from within the habitat. Last but not least, be sure that the Dubia roaches can escape the 90F temperature if they desire (include a cooler region no lower than 60F for example). Overall, their habitat should range anywhere between 60F and 90F.

## 3) Provide Food & Water

The process of offering a nutritious diet for your Dubia roaches is known as "gut-loading". 
In other words, what you feed your Dubia roaches will eventually be consumed by your Bearded 
Dragon when your reptile eats the Dubia roaches. Thus, keep this in mind when planning the 
diet for your Dubia roaches. For food, we suggest offering fresh fruits and vegetables. For 
example, sweet potatoes, carrots, bananas, or even apples. Of course, you should always keep 
fruits and vegetables fresh and never let them spoil. Besides fruits and vegetables, companies 
that specialize in Dubia roach breeding often have their own specially formulated food to which 
you can purchase. For example, roach chow. As for water, we suggest using a no-spill product known as water crystals.

## 4) Get a Starter Colony

If all requirements are met, meaning housing, food, water, and so on, then 
these insects will breed on their own during adulthood. However, it is important 
to have a good male to female ratio within the colony. For example, you 
should have just one adult male Dubia roach per four adult female Dubia roaches. 
If too many males are present, then they may harm each other or the colony itself. 
With that said, once a male successfully mates with a female, then the female will 
lay an egg capsule consisting of 20-35 nymphs every month (live birth). Keep in mind, 
the more roaches you start out with, the more babies you'll end up with. Although, 
don't forget to maintain a proper male to female ratio.

## 5) Maintain Humidity

Dubia roaches do not have any specific humidity requirements. However, 
humidity may help Dubia roaches shed. At the same time, the colony itself
may be harmed if the humidity is high and ventilation is poor. To explain, 
humidity and poor ventilation may lead to fungus growing within the habitat. As a result, 
this could harm the colony and make the Dubia roaches get sick. In general, try to 
maintain a humidity range between 40% and 60%.

## 6) Maintain Cleanliness

It's important to keep your roach colony as clean as possible, perhaps make a 
habit to clean things out at least once per week if not daily. To elaborate, 
it's best to make sure that fruits and vegetables (their food) do not spoil. In 
other words, get rid of bad food and replace it with fresh food. Furthermore, the roach 
colony will eventually have an excess buildup of droppings (also known as frass). 
Eventually, the frass will have to be removed as well (perhaps once a week).

## 7) Sort the Colony

Eventually, there will come a time when you'll want to separate the young 
Dubia roaches from the older Dubia roaches. Otherwise, the young may become 
prey to the older Dubia roaches. While cleaning the habitat, it may be a 
good time to also consider sorting the colony. To sort a colony, you'll 
want to have multiple buckets available, each bucket should have countless holes 
in the bottom of the bucket. To clarify, one bucket could have 1/8" holes punctured 
in the bottom of the bucket, another bucket could have 1/4" holes, another bucket 
could have 1/2" holes, and so on. Basically, it will depend on what 
size Dubia roaches you are trying to sort. Ultimately, the goal is to dump your colony 
into these buckets (while shaking them gently) so that certain sized Dubia roaches may fall through the holes into a different sterilite tub. Hence, sorting the colony.

## #1. They're Docile

Bearded Dragons are considered to be friendly reptiles, a Bearded 
Dragon will only bite if it feels threatened. If you properly 
handle a Bearded Dragon and treat it nicely, then the reptile 
will most likely never act aggresive towards you. In other words, 
the reptile will have no issue with being handled. Overall, since 
Bearded Dragons are friendly, they can be good pets for kids, 
teenagers, or adults.

## #2. They're Diurnal

Bearded Dragons are diurnal, this means that they are active 
during the day and sleep during the night. For obvious reasons, 
having a pet available to interact with during the day is ideal 
since humans are also diurnal (well, at least most of us are). In 
short, if you're looking for a daytime reptile, then look no further!

## #3. They Have a Long Lifespan

If kept physically and mentally healthy, a captive Bearded Dragon can 
live longer than 10 years. Of course, having a pet for that long can 
create some good memories. I mean, consider me for a second. I got my 
first Bearded Dragon back in 2012 and now look at me. To clarify, I'm 
managing an entire community about Bearded Dragons. My Bearded Dragons 
have already done so much for me. In summary, having a pet Bearded 
Dragon can be a long-term commitment that is rewarding in many ways.

## #4. They're Affordable

Most pet stores will sell young (normal) Bearded Dragons for $60 or less. If a 
Bearded Dragon is an adult or a rare type of morph, then it could cost 
$100 or more. Regardless, a young standard Bearded Dragon can be obtained 
for fairly cheap. In fact, some may be available for as low as $30.

Assuming you have nothing, then the cost of a Bearded Dragon's tank along with 
everything it needs (lights, substrate, tank decor, supplements, etc.) should 
come out to around $300 give or take. In fact, I just calculated this myself on 
Petco's website. In brief, a Bearded Dragon's setup will cost you a few hundred 
but even that isn't too bad if you have a job.

To recap, the most expensive part of getting a Bearded Dragon is actually getting 
a Bearded Dragon along with everything it needs. However, beyond that 
point, Bearded Dragons are pretty cheap to take care of. After you 
have everything the reptile needs, the main expense that you will have 
would be buying its food (along with the occasional vet checkup). However, you 
can save money on food buy ordering in bulk online rather than getting it from your 
local pet store.

## #5. They're Easy to Take Care Of

After doing research and getting a proper Bearded Dragon enclosure setup, 
the main duties of Bearded Dragon care involve feeding the reptile and cleaning 
it along with its enclosure. Aside from that, a Bearded Dragon will spend the 
majority of its day just basking under its heat bulb. For that reason, I believe 
most people consider Bearded Dragons to be "beginner" pets since they don't really 
do much in general. That is, unless you take them out to explore and interact with 
them. Ultimately, Bearded Dragons don't require much work outside of making sure they 
have the proper enclosure setup, are well-fed, and kept clean.

## #6. They're Small

Bearded Dragons grow to a max-length around 2ft. Compared to some other reptiles 
out there (such as an Iguana that grows up to 7 feet long), this is pretty nice size. 
If you're worried about space, then an adult Bearded Dragon can be housed in a 40 gallon 
tank (36"W x 18"D x 12"H). In other words, a Bearded Dragon's enclosure will only take up
3 feet of space assuming you house it in the minimum size that we would recommend (a 40 gallon 
terrarium).

## #7. They Look and Sound Awesome

I always enjoy telling non-reptile owners that I have a Bearded Dragon and watching their facial expression 
as if I really have a dragon with a beard. Not only that, but I also enjoy showing them cool pictures of 
my Bearded Dragons with their beard puffed out as if I had to capture that ferocious looking reptile. In truth, 
Bearded Dragons are just adorable and derpy little reptiles but most people don't know that so allow me to live 
in my fantasy world of taming dragons. All things considered, it's pretty cool to have a Bearded Dragon and 
explain what they are to people that aren't familiar with them.

## #8. They Don't Need Friends

Unlike some pets, Bearded Dragons don't get lonely. In fact, Bearded Dragons are territorial with 
each other. As a result, Bearded Dragons actually prefer to live in solitude and they don't want 
nor do they need friends. If you plan to become a Bearded Dragon owner, then you won't have to worry 
about buying more than one Bearded Dragon.

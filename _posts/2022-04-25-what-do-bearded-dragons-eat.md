## 1) Omnivores

Bearded Dragons are omnivores, they eat food of both plant 
and animal origin. In summary, it is important that a 
Bearded Dragon's diet has variety and is not restricted to 
any one type of food.

## 2) Live Food

At a young age, Bearded Dragons will rely more on live 
food to thrive. Dubia roaches would be a great choice 
for an everday staple feeder for your reptile. Though, 
other options exist as well as seen below.

**Daily Choices:**
- Dubia roaches (dusting recommended).
- Crickets (dusting recommended).
- Phoenix worms.
- Silkworms.

**Treats Only:**
- Butterworms (fattening).
- Waxworms (fattening).
- Superworms (fattening).
- Mealworms (Digestion risk).
- Hornworms (Mostly moisture).

## 3) Vegetables & Fruits

As Bearded Dragons get older, they may show more 
interest in vegetables. However, it's advised to 
make a habit of offering both live food and vegetables 
at a young age. Again, a diet full of variety is key.

**Suggested Greens & Veggies:**

- Mustard greens.
- Dandelion greens.
- Turnip greens.
- Collard greens.
- Endive.
- Escarole.
- Butternut Squash
- Acorn Squash

**Greens & Veggies to Avoid:**

Not all veggies are safe or nutritional for Bearded Dragons. If 
you are ever unsure if a Bearded Dragon can eat something, then 
please Google it first or simply do not attempt it. In the meantime, 
here is a brief list of vegetables to avoid.

- Lettuce (No nutritional value).
- Spinach (calcium binding).
- Beet Tops (calcium binding).
- Rhubarb (toxic).
- Avocado (toxic).

**Fruits as Treats:**

There is not much to say about fruits, besides the fact 
that they should be offered as treats only. Below, is a 
small list of fruits. Again, as treats only.

- Apples
- Bananas
- Blueberries
- Blackberries
- Strawberries

Remember, not all veggies or fruits are safe or nutritional. 
For example, citrus fruits should be avoided for Bearded Dragons.

## 4) Supplements

It's crucial to note that Bearded Dragons 
do not get everything they need from the bugs we often 
feed them. Furthermore, they do not get everything they 
need from the artificial lighting we provide as well. To 
make up for this, we must supplement their food to provide them 
with additional vitamins for them to thrive. With that said, 
we recommend using calcium and multivitamin supplements alongside 
your Bearded Dragon's diet. For more information on food 
supplementation, read our care guide <a href="https://beardeddragonowners.com/bearded-dragon-care-guide.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## 5) Gut-loading

You may be suprised to hear this, but properly taking care 
of your reptile's live food (whether it be roaches or crickets) 
is also important. To clarify, if your Bearded Dragon's dubia 
roaches are well-fed (gut-loaded) and kept healthy, then your 
Bearded Dragon will also be healthy and benefit once he or she 
eats the dubia roaches. Depending on what live food you intend 
to use as a staple feeder, it's worth looking up a care guide on 
how to proplery house and care for the live food of your choice.

## 6) Feeding Schedule

It's recommended to have a proper feeding schedule 
for a pet Bearded Dragon. For baby and juvenile 
Bearded Dragons, they should be fed 2-3 times per 
day. Per feeding, offer as much food as the reptile 
is willing to eat until it stops showing interest. Once 
the Bearded Dragon stops showing interest, stop offering 
food. For adult Bearded Dragons, it is likely that they 
will eat less in general but offering food 2-3 times 
per day is a general guideline to follow if not 1-2 times 
per day for adult Bearded Dragons.

## 7) Dangerous Foods

A pet Bearded Dragon should never be offered 
food from outside. In other words, never offer 
a Bearded Dragon a wild insect, small rodent, or 
vegetation from outside. In brief, doing so would 
be risky for various reasons. For example, a wild bug could have parasites 
or some kind of illness or infection. In fact, some 
bugs are toxic to Bearded Dragons. Thus, it is better 
to be safe than sorry.
